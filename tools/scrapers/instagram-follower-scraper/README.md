## Rate Limiting & Best Practices

- The scraper includes built-in 3-second delays between requests to be respectful to Instagram
- Instagram has rate limiting policies, so avoid scraping too many profiles too quickly
- Consider running the scraper during off-peak hours
- Monitor for any Instagram changes that might break selectors
- Works best with public Instagram profiles

## Platform Support

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Instagram | âœ… | Optimized for Instagram follower count extraction |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Selector not found**: Instagram frequently updates their HTML structure. Check for updated selectors in the Instagram scraping function.

2. **Rate limiting**: If you get blocked by Instagram, reduce the number of URLs or increase the delay between requests.

3. **Login required**: Some Instagram profiles may require login. The scraper works best with public profiles.

4. **Private profiles**: The scraper cannot access follower counts from private Instagram profiles.

Enable debug mode by setting the environment variable:
```bash
APIFY_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG node main.js
